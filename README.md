# teamarenapaper
Games inspired by libraryaddicts Search and Destroy.
Search and Destroy, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill.

## Build
To build teamarenapaper, run `./gradlew build` in project root.
You can find `TeamArenaPaper-1.0-FOREVER.jar` in `build/libs/` once compiling is finished.

Running it requires a PaperMC 1.19.3 build and the latest ProtocolLib build (Build #612 as of 11/02/2023)

You will need to source amps and put them in serverRoot/Maps/. Documentation on map config files coming soon...
