## Build
To build teamarenapaper, run `./gradlew build` in project root.
You can find `TeamArenaPaper-1.0-FOREVER.jar` in `build/libs/` once compiling is finished.

Running it requires a PaperMC 1.19.4 build and ProtocolLib.

You will need to source amps and put them in serverRoot/Maps/. Documentation on map config files coming soon...
